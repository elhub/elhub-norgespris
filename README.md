# Elhub - Norgespris

This is the external project repository for the Norgespris project @ Elhub. This repository contains OpenAPI
specifications and JSON schemas for interfaces to be used by external systems that need to read (and write)
data about Norgespris to the Elhub system.

The purpose of this repository is to facilitate early transparency and collaboration with Market Parties and
System vendors in the power market. By making the specifications publicly available, we invite developers,
vendors, and other stakeholders to begin integration planning, provide feedback, and help us shape the best
possible interfaces for the ecosystem.

## ðŸ“Œ Status

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These specifications are under active development and subject to change. The purpose of releasing this at this
> early stage is to give opportunities for feedback and (if necessary) to iterate over the solution. We recommend
> syncing regularly to stay up to date with the latest changes.

Version: v0.1 (Pre-release)

> [!NOTE]
