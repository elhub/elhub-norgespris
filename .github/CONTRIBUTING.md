## Code of Conduct

We adhere to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Issue Tracker

Elhub employees should generally use our internal Jira instance (follow the link in the [README](../README.md));
everyone else is welcome to [open an issue on GitHub](/issues/).

When writing issues:

* Ensure you are running on the latest version.
* Always check whether there is a previous, similar issue. If there is, consider commenting on that issue rather
  than opening an entirely new issue.
* Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into. Describe what you're observing and what you
  expected, steps to reproduce the issue, technical details, etc.

> Do not, **ever**, report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the
> public issue tracker or elsewhere in public. For sensitive bugs, <email:security@elhub.no>.

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available documentation (start with ../README.md).

Post your question as a new topic in discussions or comment on an existing suitable topic.

We will try to respond as soon as possible.
